### **Stop Loss Orders with Uniswap V4 Hooks ðŸ¦„**

*"if ETH drops below $1500, market sell my bags"*

Integrated directly into the Uniswap V4 pools, stop loss orders are posted onchain and executed via the `afterSwap()` hook. No external bots or actors are required to guarantee execution.

## Use Cases

* <ins>Spot traders</ins>: protect overnight positions from downside risk

* <ins>Leverage traders</ins>: use stop loss proceeds to repay loans. Please see [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for usage

* <ins>Lending Protocols (advanced)</ins>: use stop loss orders to *liquidate collateral*. Instead of liquidation bots and external participants, stop losses offer guaranteed execution
    * Note: additional safety is required to ensure that large market orders do not result in bad debt

## Features

* Guaranteed execution -- if the pool crosses the user-specified tick, the posted capital is guaranteed to market-sell

* Asynchronous claims -- opening a stop loss order provides an ERC-1155 receipt token. Upon successful order execution, the receipt token is exchanged for the proceeds

* Generic, reusable Hook -- the hook is deployed once, new pools can utilize the already-deployed hook
